Single File Programming Question
Write a Java program to compute the area of a rectangle using method overriding to demonstrate runtime polymorphism.

Create a base class Shape with a method calculateArea().
Create a subclass Rectangle that extends Shape and overrides the calculateArea() method.
The program should prompt the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle.
Create an instance of Rectangle using a reference of type Shape.
Call the calculateArea() method to compute and print the area of the rectangle to the console.


Input format :
The program should prompt the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle on separate lines.

Output format :
The program should print a single line to the console, which shows the area of the rectangle. The line should be in the following format:



"Area of rectangle is: [area]"



where [area] is the calculated area of the rectangle, rounded to two decimal places.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10
20
Output 1 :
Area of rectangle is: 200.0
Input 2 :
200
300
Output 2 :
Area of rectangle is: 60000.0

        double b=sc.nextDouble();
        Rectangle are=new Rectangle(a,b);
        System.out.println("Area of rectangle is: "+are.cal());

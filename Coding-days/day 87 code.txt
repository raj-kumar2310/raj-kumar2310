Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



In the recruitment process, applicants employment statuses are recorded as 'E' for employed and 'U' for unemployed. Write a program that takes the status of N applicants as input and saves them in a file named employee.txt that can store the data for a maximum of 50 applicants. Read the file to count and display the number of employed and unemployed applicants.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer N, representing the number of applicants.

The second line consists of N space-separated characters, where each character is either 'E' (for Employed) or 'U' (for Unemployed), representing the employment status of each applicant.

Output format :
If the number of applicants exceeds 50 (N > 50), the output prints "Exceeding limit!" and terminates.

Otherwise, the code reads the contents of the file and displays the following:

The first line displays "Employed: " followed by the counts of employed applicants.
The second line displays "Unemployed: " followed by the counts of unemployed applicants.


Contents of the file: The employment status of N applicants (E for Employed, U for Unemployed) in separate lines.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 50

Employment status: E for Employed, U for Unemployed

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
E U U E E
Output 1 :
Employed: 3
Unemployed: 2
Input 2 :
51 
E U E E U E U E E U E U E E U E E U E U E U E E U E U E E U E E U E U E U E E U E U E E U E U E E E E
Output 2 :
Exceeding limit!
Input 3 :
2
U U
Output 3 :
Employed: 0
Unemployed: 2
Input 4 :
3
E E E
Output 4 :
Employed: 3
Unemployed: 0

Indoor Game

Ajju has a Carom board and TT table (Table Tennis). Ree needs those games. She can get it if it gives the correct answer to the Ajjuâ€™s question. He asked an area of the carom board and TT table. Ree needs your help, Help her to get those games from Ajju.

NOTE: Use the polymorphism concept and write the java program for the above problem.

Input format :
Input consist of 3 integers.



First input represents the side of carrom

Second input represents length of TT table

Third input represents breadth of TT table.

Output format :
Output consist of 2 integers.



First output represents the area of carrom.

Second output represents area of TT table.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
6
10
Output 1 :
Area of the Carrom: 25cm
Area of the TT: 60cm
Input 2 :
3
5
34
Output 2 :
Area of the Carrom: 9cm
Area of the TT: 170cm 
ANS:

// You are using Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class IndoorGame {
    // Calculate area of carrom board (square)
    public void Area(int side) {
        int area = side * side;
        System.out.print("Area of the Carrom: " + area + "cm ");
    }
    
    // Calculate area of TT table (rectangle)
    public void Area(int length, int breadth) {
        int area = length * breadth;
        System.out.print("Area of the TT: " + area + "cm");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int side = scanner.nextInt();
        int length = scanner.nextInt();
        int breadth = scanner.nextInt();
        
        IndoorGame game = new IndoorGame();
        game.Area(side);
        game.Area(length, breadth);
        
        scanner.close();

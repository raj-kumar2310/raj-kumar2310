Problem Statement



Imagine you are helping an employee calculate their income tax based on their annual salary. The tax is calculated using the following progressive tax system:



10% for salary up to Rs. 20,000.00
15% for salary above Rs. 20,000.00


Formula: Tax = Salary * Tax Rate



Use default arguments for the rates as shown in the function specification.



Function Specifications: void calculateTax(double rate1 = 0.10, double rate2 = 0.15)

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a double value S, representing the salary.

Output format :
The output prints the calculated tax amount as a double value, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ S ≤ 1,00,000.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
500.0
Output 1 :
50.00
Input 2 :
29000.0
Output 2 :
4350.00

ANS:

// You are using GCC
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    double a;
    cin>>a;
    double b=0.10;
    double c=0.15;
    if(a<=20000)
    {
        cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<a*b;
    }
    else if(a>20000)
    {
        cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<a*c;
    }
    else {
        cout<<"Invalid";
        
    }
}

Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement: Stationary Shop Management System

Create a Java program that manages information about students. The program should handle multiple functionalities, including inputting details for multiple students, calculating their total fees, and displaying details based on a specified threshold.

Use classes and objects to model students and encapsulate their information.
Utilize constructors for initialization and method calls to perform operations on student data.
Use arrays to store multiple instances of student objects, allowing for easy iteration and manipulation of student data.
Encapsulate student attributes (e.g., student ID, name, fees) using private access modifiers and provide getter methods for accessing this information.
Define methods within the Student class to calculate total fees (calculateTotalFee()) and display student details (display()).
Use conditional statements to determine which students meet the specified fee threshold and control the flow of the program accordingly.
Input format :
The first input is an integer n, representing the number of students.

For each student, the input includes:

Student ID (integer)
Student Name (string)
Tuition Fee (double)
Exam Fee (double)
The last input is a double value representing the minimum total fee threshold.

Output format :
Display each student whose total fee (sum of tuition fee and exam fee) is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.

If no student meets the threshold, display "No students found with Total Fee : threshold"



Refer to Sample Output for Formatting Specifications.

Tuition Fee: $1500.0
Exam Fee: $100.0

Student ID: 1002
Student Name: Bob 
Tuition Fee: $1800.0
Exam Fee: $120.0

Student ID: 1003

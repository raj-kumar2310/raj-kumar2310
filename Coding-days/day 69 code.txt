Single File Programming Question
Scott is  developing a program to manage student enrollments at a university. Each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course has a certain number of credits. Your task is to create a program that reads a list of enrollments and calculates the total number of credits each student has enrolled in.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of enrollments.

The next n lines each describe an enrollment. Each enrollment consists of:

student_id: A string representing the unique identifier of the student.

course_id: A string representing the unique identifier of the course.

credits: An integer representing the number of credits for the course.

Output format :
For each student, output their student_id followed by their total number of credits enrolled in.

Print each student's information on a new line.

Students should be listed in alphabetical order of their student_id.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1
S001 C001 3
Output 1 :
S001 3

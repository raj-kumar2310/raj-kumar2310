To Calculate the Perimeter of the Pool Pocket

Akhil has a pool table(8 ball-pool table) and it is rectangular in shape. Akhil wants to calculate the perimeter of the pool table and the perimeter of its pocket. Help him to find out. Create a class with the name PoolTable which has three Public instance variables length, width, and pocketSize which represent the dimensions of the pool table and the diameter of its pocket. Create a method "calculatePerimeter()" which calculates the perimeter of the pool table and "calculatePerimeter()" which calculates the Perimeter of the pocket.

Input format :
Input consists of 3 values

The first input represents the length of the pool table in meters

The second input represents the width of the pool table in meters

The third input represents the diameter of the pocket in meters

Output format :
The output consists of two double values

The first output represents the perimeter of the pool table with precision value '1'.

The second output represents the perimeter of the pocket with precision value '1'.

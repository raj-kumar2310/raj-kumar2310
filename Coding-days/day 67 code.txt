Carl is working on a system that tracks student grades. Each student has a unique identifier and a grade. Your task is to create a program that reads a list of student grades and prints each student identifier along with their grade.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, the number of students.

The next n lines each contain a string student_id (the identifier of the student) and an integer grade (the grade of the student).

Output format :
Print each student_id and their grade in the following format

Each line should contain a student_id and their grade, separated by a space.

The students should be listed in alphabetical order of their student_id.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
Alice 85
Bob 90
Charlie 78
Output 1 :
Alice 85
Bob 90
Charlie 78

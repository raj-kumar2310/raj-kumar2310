    }
}



public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
         String i = scanner.nextLine();
       System.out.println(i);
       System.out.println(input);
        scanner.close();
    }
}

Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Sharath is assigned to develop a program for an office word processing tool. The program should compare two input words provided by the user and determine if they are anagrams of each other.



It should output a message indicating whether the words are anagrams or not, considering all characters in the words.



Assist Sharath in completing the program.

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated strings.

Output format :
The output displays a single line output which should be one of the following:

"<str1> and <str2> are anagram of each other." (if they are anagrams)

"<str1> and <str2> are not anagram of each other." (if they are not anagrams)



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The length of each string will not exceed 1000 characters.

The strings can contain only lowercase alphabets.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
keep peek
Output 1 :
keep and peek are anagram of each other.
Input 2 :
jake john
Output 2 :
jake and john are not anagram of each other.

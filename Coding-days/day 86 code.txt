Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



David runs a car rental service and wants to create a RentalCost class to calculate the total cost for renting a car. The class should take the number of days and the daily rate as inputs to compute the final rental cost.



Your task is to implement this class to calculate the total cost and offer a loyalty discount if the rental duration is long enough.



Note: totalCost = numberOfDays * dailyRate * (1 - (loyaltyDiscount / 100))

Where loyaltyDiscount is 10 if numberOfDays >= 7, otherwise 0.

Input format :
The first line contains an integer representing numberOfDays.

The second line contains a float representing dailyRate.

Output format :
The first line of output displays "Total rental cost: ₹x" where x is the calculated total cost rounded to 2 decimal places.

The second line displays "Loyalty discount applied" if the number of days is 7 or more, otherwise "No loyalty discount".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following conditions:

1 ≤ numberOfDays ≤ 30

20.0 ≤ dailyRate ≤ 500.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
50.0
Output 1 :
Total rental cost: ₹250.00
No loyalty discount
Input 2 :
10
75.5
Output 2 :
Total rental cost: ₹679.50
Loyalty discount applied

ANS:

// You are using GCC
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n;
    float a;
    cin>>n>>a;
    float b;
    
    if(n>=7)
    {
        b=n*a*(1-0.10);
        cout<<"Total rental cost: ₹"<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<b<<endl;
        cout<<"Loyalty discount applied";
        
    }
    else
    {
        b=n*a;
        cout<<"Total rental cost: ₹"<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<b<<endl;
        cout<<"No loyalty discount";
    }

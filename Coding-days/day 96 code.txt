Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Create a program to calculate the fine amount for overdue book returns. The program takes the number of days a book is overdue as input. 



If the book is returned on or before 7 days overdue, there is no fine. 
If the book is returned between 8 days and 15 (inclusive) overdue, the fine rate is Rs. 2 per day. 
If the book is returned 16 days or after overdue, the fine rate increases to Rs. 5 per day.


The program calculates and displays the fine amount in Rupees based on the input using class and object.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer n, representing the number of days overdue.

Output format :
The output prints "Rs. " followed by an integer representing the fine amount based on the number of days overdue.



Refer to the sample outputs for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 30

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4
Output 1 :
Rs. 0
Input 2 :
9
Output 2 :
Rs. 18
Input 3 :
16
Output 3 :
Rs. 59

ANS:

// You are using GCC
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    if(n<=7)
    {
        cout<<"Rs. "<<"0";
    }
    else if(n>7 && n<=15)
    {
        cout<<"Rs. "<<n*2;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"Rs. "<<(n*5)-21;
    }
    return 0;
}

Single File Programming Question
Ajay is  developing a system for a library to keep track of book borrowings. Each book has a unique identifier, and every borrowing record contains the book identifier and the number of times it has been borrowed. Your task is to create a program that reads a list of borrowing records and prints each book identifier along with the total number of times it has been borrowed.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, the number of borrowing records.

The next n lines each contain a string book_id (the identifier of the book) and an integer borrow_count (the number of times the book was borrowed in that record).

Output format :
Print each book_id and its total borrow count in the following format:

Each line should contain a book_id and its total borrow count, separated by a space.

The books should be listed in alphabetical order of their book_id.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
bookA 4
bookB 2
bookA 3
Output 1 :
bookA 7
bookB 2

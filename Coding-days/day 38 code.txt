Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement:

You are tasked with creating an application that calculates the salary of teachers based on their job title. The program should have a superclass called Teacher with a method calculateSalary() that returns the basic salary. There should be two subclasses called FullTimeTeacher and PartTimeTeacher which override the calculateSalary() method to add a bonus or calculate pay based on hourly rates, respectively.

The program should prompt the user to enter the details of a FullTimeTeacher and a PartTimeTeacher, including their name, basic salary, bonus for full-time teachers, and hourly rate and hours worked for part-time teachers.

The program should then create objects of the FullTimeTeacher and PartTimeTeacher classes and call their respective calculateSalary() methods. Finally, the program should display the calculated salaries for both teachers.

Input format :
The program takes user input through standard input. The user is prompted to enter the following information:

Full-Time Teacher name
Full-Time Teacher basic salary
Full-Time Teacher bonus
Part-Time Teacher name
Part-Time Teacher hourly rate
Part-Time Teacher hours worked
The input is provided in the order listed above, with each value on a separate line.

Output format :
The program outputs the calculated salaries for the full-time teacher and part-time teacher.

"Full-Time Teacher Salary: <full_time_teacher_salary>"

"Part-Time Teacher Salary: <part_time_teacher_salary>"



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.



Code constraints :
The basic salary, bonus, hourly rate, and hours worked are positive numbers

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
Smith
50000
10000
Johnson
50
30
Output 1 :
Full-Time Teacher Salary: 60000.00
Part-Time Teacher Salary: 1500.00
Input 2 :
John Doe
70000
15000
Jane Doe

Output 2 :
Full-Time Teacher Salary: 85000.00
Part-Time Teacher Salary: 1800.00

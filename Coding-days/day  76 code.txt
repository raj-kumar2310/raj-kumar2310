Single File Programming Question
Problem statement



You have been assigned the task of writing a program that calculates the sum of a series where each term is the factorial of a number divided by that number.



Your program should take the integer value n as input and calculate the sum of the series from 1 to 'n'. 



The series is defined as: 1!/1 + 2!/2 + 3!/3 + ... + n!/n.



Function Specifications



int fact(int n)

Input format :
The input consists of an integer n representing the upper limit.

Output format :
The output displays the sum of the hiven series.

Code constraints :
1 <= n <= 10

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
Output 1 :
34

ANS:

// You are using GCC
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int fact;
    cin>>fact;
    
    int f=1,d,sum=0;
    if(fact>0){
    
    for(int i=1;i<=fact;i++)
    {
        f=f*i;
        d=f/i;
        sum=sum+d;
    }
    }
   cout<<sum;
}

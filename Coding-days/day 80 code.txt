Problem Statement



Hopper is a cyclist and is working on a program to calculate the distance he travels on his bicycle. He created a Pedal class to represent his pedal rate and overloaded the * operator to calculate the distance using his initial speed and the time he pedals. 



Help Hopper write a program that demonstrates operator overloading and displays the calculated distance in meters.



Formula: Distance = 0.5 * Pedal Rate * Time Taken * Time Taken

Input format :
The input consists of three space-separated float values:

Initial speed (in m/s)
Pedal rate (in m/s2)
Time Taken(in s)
Output format :
The output displays a float value representing the distance traveled followed by " m/s", rounded to two decimal places.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 <= Initial speed <= 100

1 <= Pedal rate <= 10

1 <= Time Taken <= 20

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5.5 2.5 9.8
Output 1 :
134.75 m
Input 2 :
10.0 2.0 5.0
Output 2 :
100.00 m

ANS:

// You are using GCC
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
// class  Pedal
// {
//     int d;
// }
int main()
{
    float a,b,c;
    cin>>a>>b>>c;
    float d=a*b*c;
    cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<d<<" m";
    // Pedal(d);
}

Problem Statement



Sam is working on a text analysis tool, and he needs your help to implement a class that counts the occurrences of a specific character in a given string.



Your task is to create a class called Occurrence with methods to initialize the string and character and count the occurrences of the character within the string.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a string.

The second line consists of a single character.

Output format :
The output prints an integer, representing the count of occurrences of the character within the string.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The input string consists of only lowercase English letters.

The character is a valid ASCII character.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
utter
t
Output 1 :
2
Input 2 :
world
e
Output 2 :
0

ANS:

// You are using GCC
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
// class Occurrence{
    
    

int main()
{
    string a;
    char b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    int l=a.length();
    
    int co =0;
    for(int i=0;i<l;i++)
    {
        if( b== a[i])
        {
            co++;
        }
    }
     
     cout<<co;
     
     
    
    
    
}

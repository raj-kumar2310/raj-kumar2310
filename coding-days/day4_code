Single File Programming Question
The Acme Tennis Ball Company is designing a new box to ship its products. The marketing department wants a triangular box that can hold 4 balls, as in the illustration below. The balls fit exactly inside the box, just touching all three walls and the end caps of the container. All 3 walls of the box are the same size (equilateral triangle). Assume a tennis ball is 6 cm in diameter, and ignore the thickness of the box material. What will be the length and breadth of the material used to make the box? Write a program that finds the measure of a side of the box. Program must also display the length and breadth of the material used to make the triangular box.







Input format :
The input consists of the diameter of the box.

Output format :
The output displays the side of the box, length and breadth of the material used to make the triangular box separated by a space.

Round off the float values to two decimal places.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
6
Output 1 :
Side : 10.39
Length : 31.18
Breadth : 24.00

import java.text.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
        DecimalFormat dc=new DecimalFormat("0.00");
        double p=s.nextDouble();
        // scanner.close();
        double r=p/2;
        
        double side=(6*p/2)/Math.sqrt(3);
        
        double l=side*3;
        double br=4*p;
        
        System.out.println("Side : "+dc.format(side));
        System.out.println("Length : "+dc.format(l));
        System.out.println("Breadth : "+dc.format(br));
    
    // System.out.println(r);
    
    }
}

Problem Statement



Nila is in the process of developing a web crawling application aimed at mapping the structure of a website. In this representation, the website is depicted as a graph, where each webpage serves as a node and the hyperlinks connecting webpages act as edges.



Your task is to create a program that utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal to explore and map the structure of a website, starting from a given URL and discovering all linked pages within the website.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of two space-separated integers, V and E, representing the number of webpages and hyperlinks on the website.

The next lines of input consists of two space-separated integers, Details about each hyperlink are represented by two integers u and v, indicating a hyperlink from webpage u to webpage v.

Output format :
The output displays the order in which webpages were visited during the BFS traversal, separated by spaces. The traversal order serves as a map of the website structure, indicating how webpages are connected.

Code constraints :
The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

1 <= V <= 10

0 <= E <= V*(V-1)/2

0 <= u, v < V

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4 4
0 1
0 2
1 3
2 3
Output 1 :
0 1 2 3 
Input 2 :
5 6
0 1
0 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
3 4
Output 2 :
0 1 2 3 4

            int v = sc.nextInt();
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            graph.get(v).add(u);

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();

        q.add(0);
        visited[0] = true;

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = q.poll();
            System.out.print(curr + " ");

            for (int nei : graph.get(curr)) {
                if (!visited[nei]) {
                    visited[nei] = true;
                    q.add(nei);
                }
            }

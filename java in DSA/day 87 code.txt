Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Lithish is working on a project that involves analyzing the connectivity of various data points represented as vertices in a graph. He needs to perform Depth First Traversal (DFS) on the given graph (connected undirected graph) to explore its vertices and understand the relationships between them.



Write a program to help Lithish perform DFS on the given graph.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the two integers V and E, separated by a space. V represents the number of vertices, and E represents the number of edges in the graph.

The next E lines consist of two integers, v and w, separated by a space, indicating an edge between vertex v and vertex w.

The last line of input consists of the startVertex, representing the starting vertex for DFS traversal.

Output format :
The output should print the Depth First Traversal of the graph starting from a specified vertex, following format:

"Depth First Traversal starting from vertex [vertex]:

[u1] [u2] [u3]... [un]".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

2 ≤ V ≤ 10

0 <= E <= V*(V-1)/2

0 <= v, w < V

0 ≤ startVertex < V

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4 3
0 1
1 2
2 3
0
Output 1 :
Depth First Traversal starting from vertex 0:
0 1 2 3 
Input 2 :
4 6
0 1
0 2
1 2
2 0
2 3
3 0
1
Output 2 :
Depth First Traversal starting from vertex 1:
1 2 0 3

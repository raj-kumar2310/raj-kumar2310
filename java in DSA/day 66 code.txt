Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Kathir is learning about binary search trees (BSTs) in his computer science class. He has just implemented a simple program to create a binary search tree and calculate the sum of all its leaf nodes. Can you help him validate his code and solve some scenarios to test it?



For example, consider a tree with the following structure:

   5

   / \

  3  7

  / \  \

 2  4  9



In this tree, the leaf nodes are 2, 4, and 9. The program should compute the sum of these leaf node elements, which is 2 + 4 + 9 = 15.

Input format :
The input consists of a series of positive integers as input, each on a separate line.

The input terminates when Kathir enters -1. This signifies the end of input.

You can assume that the input integers are unique.

Output format :
The output displays the sum of all the leaf nodes in the binary search tree.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
All input integers will be positive integers (greater than 0).

The number of nodes in the binary tree is at most 100.

The value of each node is at most 100.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
3
7
2
4
9
-1
Output 1 :
Sum of all leaf nodes are 15
Input 2 :
6
3
1
4
2
-1
Output 2 :
Sum of all leaf nodes are 6

Single File Programming Question
Rakesh gets to know that binary numbers are formed with just 0 and 1. He gets excited and decides to find all the binary numbers starting from 1 by adding/replacing a 0 or 1. 

For example, after 1, he adds a 0 to it and arrives 10. Then, he replaces 0 with 1 to get 11 as the next digit and so on. Upon seeing the work, his mentor planned to play a game with him where Rakesh will be given a number N and he has to arrive at the first N binary numbers using this method.

To check the correctness of Rakesh, his mentor decided to build a code that does the same process. Since he is not well-versed in programming he has employed you to do the same. Since you are good at data structures, you think queues will be of good use in this scenario.

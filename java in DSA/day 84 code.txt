Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Shekin is developing a program to assist a robot in navigating a warehouse. The warehouse is depicted as a grid, with specific cells representing obstacles that the robot must avoid.



Your task is to create a program that uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine a path for the robot to travel from an initial position to a designated target location within the warehouse.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of two integers separated by a space: V and E, where V represents the number of vertices (cells) in the warehouse grid and E represents the number of edges (connections between cells) indicating possible paths.

The next E lines each consist of two integers, v and w, separated by a space, representing an edge connecting cell v to cell w.

The last line consists of a single integer, startVertex, which is the starting position of the robot within the warehouse.

Output format :
The output should print a message in the format "Depth First Traversal starting from vertex [startVertex]:", where [startVertex] is the integer representing the initial cell.



Following that next line, it should list the visited cells in DFS traversal order, separated by spaces.



Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

Code constraints :
The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

2 ≤ V ≤ 10

0 <= E <= V*(V-1)/2

0 <= v, w < V

0 <= startVertex <= V

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
6 6
0 1
0 2
1 3
2 4
3 5
4 5
0
Output 1 :
Depth First Traversal starting from vertex 0:
0 1 3 5 2 4 
Input 2 :
5 4
0 1
0 2
1 3
3 4
0
Output 2 :
Depth First Traversal starting from vertex 0:
0 1 3 4 2
